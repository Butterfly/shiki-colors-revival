# shiki-colors-revival
This consists mostly of a script that modifies the original Numix theme's files
to fit to all of the colors in the GNOME Colors palette.

At the moment, these themes are currently intended to be used with Xfce4, since
that's what I use. If you run into problems in another desktop environment,
I'll try to help the best I can though.

Relevant license files can be found underneath the folders. (Numix is GPL-3,
Xfwm4 is GPL-2, Plank themes and build system are ISC)

## Included
- GTK 2 and 3 themes
- Xfwm4 themes
- [Plank](https://launchpad.net/plank) themes

## Downloading
Either use `git` to clone this repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Somasis/shiki-colors-revival

or just [download the latest release](releases).

## Installing
1. Open a terminal in this repo's directory.
2. `make`
3. `make install` as root

**Exherbo users**:
    There is an exheres in ::somasis; x11-themes/shiki-colors-revival.

## How this works
In order to minimize the amount of maintenance needed, we base these themes off
of [Numix] so that we benefit from the [shimmerproject]'s work on Numix.
The themes are then generated by using regular expressions to replace certain
variables in the CSS to change the colors to fit the [GNOME Colors palette]
rather than using Numix's default colors. (currently only the selected
background color is replaced)

As a result of doing it this method, we don't have to worry about updating the
CSS every time GNOME's developers decide to break everything with a new minor
version of GTK3, again. We can make upstream do all the work. :)

## Current problems
- I'm still learning GTK, and GNOME developers, for some god-only-knows-why
  reason they decided to provide pretty awful documentation.
- Eventually this will stop working since GNOME developers will probably think
  that GTK 3 on non-GNOME environments is deprecated or something, and not worth
  their support. It's probably better to use Qt in the future.
- It doesn't look exactly like the original theme; part of this is intentional,
  part of it is that the theme looks better, to me, than the original one.
